# Concentric CSS

A fork of [Brandon Rhodes' Concentric CSS](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/Concentric-CSS) - a CSS property ordering system that starts from outside the box model and moves inward.

## Additions

- 2025-04-11. Updated property ordering to reflect modern `box-sizing: border-box` standards, moving width/height between margin and outline/border
- 2025-04-11. Added `container-type` to new group, `containers`
